# ðŸŽ“ Student Career Recommendation System

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The **Student Career Recommendation System** is a machine learningâ€“based web application that helps students identify suitable career paths based on their academic performance, technical skills, and soft skills.  

The system takes inputs such as marks in subjects (Maths, Science), technical ability (Coding), and soft skills (Creativity, Communication) to predict the most relevant career option. The model is trained on a custom dataset and integrated into a web application for easy access.
